# Vue Storefront & EPiServer Commerce connector
This connector lets you set up an e-commerce website in no time. It allows you to seamlessly integrate the progressive web application (PWA) Vue Storefront with EPiServer Commerce. You can now combine the best of both worlds: the solid technological backbone of an e-commerce platform and the smooth user experience of a native application.
The connector, developed by Making Waves, is a piece of open-source code that easily connects Vue Storefront and EPiServer Commerce to create one integrated e-commerce experience.

-	Shopping cart and checkout process
-	Coupon and discount functionalities
## Benefits
Setting up your e-commerce platform with the connector of Making Waves has a number of advantages:
